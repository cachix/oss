A list of issues that are not time-critical for us, but we'd like to see them done.

### axum-bridge-elm

In similar style of [servant-elm](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant-elm#readme), we'd like to translate [Axum's router](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/struct.Router.html)
into Elm module.

[elm_rs](https://crates.io/crates/elm_rs) looks like the best candidate for converting types and decoder, while the router to Elm's HTTP conversion is yet to be written.
